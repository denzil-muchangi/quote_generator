# Quote Generator App

A simple Flutter application that displays a random quote from a predefined list upon a button press.

## Features

*   **Random Quote Display:** Get a new inspiring quote every time you tap the button.
*   **Predefined Quote List:** Quotes are sourced from an internal list within the application.
*   **Simple User Interface:** A clean and intuitive design focused on displaying quotes.

## How it Works

The application's core logic resides in the `lib/main.dart` file. It maintains a list of strings, each representing a quote. When the floating action button is pressed, a random quote is selected from this list and displayed on the screen.
